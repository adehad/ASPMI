# TODOS:
## CW1:
1. Consistent use of PSD or Power Spectral Density in axis labels
2. Ensure code commenting is up to date
3. Ensure that consistent style of keeping plot properties on a new line, under the main title
4. The wrap text around figure idea is no good, type the minipage thing first though
